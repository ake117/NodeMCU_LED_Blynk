NodeMCU - Turn LED on/off from Blynk app

Cannot find the way to turn LED on/off on NodeMCU v2 so I modidy the Blynk's example sketch to working with NodeMCU. (https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/tree/master/examples/GettingStarted/BlynkBlink)
I still don't understand Blynk - How to config pin in the code, it seem Blynk auto detect which pin is using.
